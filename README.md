**Helmet Detection with YoLoV3 Algorithm**
YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, version 3) is a real-time object detection system that is fast and accurate, capable of detecting objects in images by predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities. We use YOLOv3 for helmet detection because it efficiently identifies and localizes helmets in images or video streams, ensuring safety compliance in environments such as construction sites or traffic monitoring.
